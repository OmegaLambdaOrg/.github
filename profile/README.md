# Ilmen

Welcome to my attempt at organising and archiving my life. Here you will find as close to a complete record of who I am and what I do as I am willing to share with anonymous dwellers on the internet (such as yourself). This repository is organised into a [PARA][Wiki - PARA]-like structure, which distributes topics into four categories:

## Projects: [Ennor][Projects]

## Areas: [Numenor][Areas]

## Resources: [Belegaer][Resources]

## Archive: [Aman][Archive]

---

## Lore

[Ilmen][Wiki - Ilmen] is the layer of the atmosphere around [Arda][Wiki - Arda] in which the stars are placed. When traveling along the [Straight Road][Wiki - Straight Road], one must traverse [Ilmen][Wiki - Ilmen] to reach [Aman][Wiki - Aman].
