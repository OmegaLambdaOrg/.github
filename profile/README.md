# [Ilmen][PARA]

Welcome to my attempt at organising and archiving my life. Here you will find as close to a complete record of who I am and what I do as I am willing to share with anonymous dwellers on the internet (such as yourself). This repository is organised into a [PARA][Wiki - PARA]-like structure, which distributes topics into four categories:

## Projects: [Ennor][Projects]

Everything I am actively working on, including programs, papers, presentations, tasks, and any other short-term goals I have. In a pure [PARA][Wiki - PARA] setup, this should only contain things which can be "completed", however I include here anything which I am actively *using*, even when I'm no longer developing or maintaining it.

## Areas: [Numenor][Areas]

Notes, tasks, reminders, and documentation for long-term or ongoing goals and responsibilities I have throughout my life.

## Resources: [Belegaer][Resources]

This is where I store files, data, templates, and any other products which may be useful for current or future [Projects] and [Areas].

## Archive: [Aman][Archive]

When a [Project][Projects] has been completed, an [Area][Areas] is no longer relevant, or a [Resource][Resources] becomes deprecated or defunct, they are moved here. This avoids losing information but ensures everying within the preceding categories remains relevant.

## Lore

[Ilmen][Wiki - Ilmen] is the layer of the atmosphere around [Arda][Wiki - Arda] in which the stars are placed. When traveling along the [Straight Road][Wiki - Straight Road], one must traverse [Ilmen][Wiki - Ilmen] to reach [Aman][Wiki - Aman].
